   You went to the mall with your parents and your litte brother and your parents were going to get a present for your brother. They left you to take care of your brother. While you were looking for a new pair of shoes, he gets lost. You start panicking and come up with three places where he could be: Target, the food court, or Game Stop. Where should you check first?
